# BotChallenge-Asteroids

This is Bot Challenge 1 (of.. some amount)! There is a global Server app that runs the game, 
a Human-player component with a web view, and the Bot programming section. 

This README will be a lot more fully featured as the game is fleshed out. 

I'm hoping to make everything interact with WebSockets, something I've never worked with before, 
so we're going to see how that goes. I don't plan on using, I think SignalR is the standard C# library
for it? I want to try it directly, with like a Middleware type first. We'll see.
