# BotChallenge-Asteroids

This is Bot Challenge 1 (of.. some amount)! There is a global Server app that runs the game, 
a console to program your bot in, and a React app (served through the default route in the Server app) to play as a human. 

This README will be a lot more fully featured as the game is fleshed out. 

I'm hoping to make everything interact with WebSockets, something I've never worked with before, 
so we're going to see how that goes. I don't plan on using, I think SignalR is the standard C# library
for it? I want to try it directly, with like a Middleware type first. We'll see.
